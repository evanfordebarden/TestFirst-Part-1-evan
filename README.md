### TestFirst JavaScript Overview   

TestFirst JavaScript is a multi-part series that provides practice to intermediate to advanced javascript concepts. The majority of concepts introduced in TestFirst have mini lessons and practice exercises in the workshops on learndot. However, there will be new concepts introduced in TestFirst that you will need to learn on your own by reading documentation (it's important to begin learning how to read documentation efficiently!)

### Before beginning your assignment, make sure you have completed these steps: 

1. Forked & cloned the TestFirst repository.
2. Installed node and a text editor.


### Setup Test First

- **[Fork the repository to your personal GitHub Account](https://github.com/fullstackacademy/TestFirst-Part-1/)**
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Run `testem` with the `npx testem` command.


### Run Testem with npx testem

In your TestFirst directory run the command:

```sh
$ npx testem
```

After `testem` initiates, connect to `localhost:7357` in your web browser and your test specs will load.
